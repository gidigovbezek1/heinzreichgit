 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1948, the Germans brought the Allies on their knees on the plains of the Netherlands. The eventual later rise of the United Socialist States of America brought in a new war- a cold war. But Germany was not to be defeated- and now America's own wounds leave its empire on the verge of implosion. But just as one conflict ends, another begins; in the east, the Indians have been gradually gaining strength and influence- and with their economic power soon potentially outshining Germany's, the Axis may be influenced to act- fast to maintain their position of dominance. Meanwhile, Chinese sabre-rattling gets louder by the day as its internal politics grow weaker than ever. Just as the world seemed to be able to take a breather, a single spark may once again be all it takes to bring humanity to a new global conflict."

 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the failure of the Netherlands Campaign, the British people, tired of the near-decade of war with the Germans, had had enough. With the chains of the Ancien Regime broken, the Union of Britain chose another path- the path of communism. /n/n However, with its once-grand empire broken off forever from its motherland, the British State went into a period of irreversible decline, eventually becoming an effective protectorate of the Americans... Now, the seemingly near-inevitable collapse of the USSA could spell doom for the already weak British State. Can it survive these tumultuous times, or must it be swept away into the tides of history?"

 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the failure of the IJN to stop the blistering pace of the Americo-Australasian advances into its Pacific territories, Japan found itself on the victorious side of the 2nd World War. However, its empire was not to last. After a decade of guerrilla warfare, the Japanese finally granted the Chinese independence- and has been regretting it ever since. Twice now, the Chinese have nearly destroyed the Japanese Empire. With the increasing intensity of Chinese sabre-rattling over the Legation Cities, it appears that once again, the Sun and Moon must fight for their position in the skies."

 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the World Wars, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
